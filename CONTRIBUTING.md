## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/sindrel/excalidraw-converter).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/sindrel/excalidraw-converter/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/sindrel/excalidraw-converter/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/sindrel/excalidraw-converter). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/sindrel/excalidraw-converter/issues?q=label%3Abug+is:open).
- Collect information about the bug:
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. See the [security guidelines](SECURITY.md) for instructions.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/sindrel/excalidraw-converter/issues/new).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/sindrel/excalidraw-converter) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/sindrel/excalidraw-converter/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

<!-- omit in toc -->
